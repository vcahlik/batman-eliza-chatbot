# Batman Eliza-like chatbot in Python

Hugely based on [Wade Brainerd's Eliza chatbot in Python](https://github.com/wadetb/eliza), with pretty much only the script file edited to change the setting of the chat into an interrogation by Batman.

Created in order to support the hypothesis that much of the Dark Knight's dialogues can be reconstructed by simple pattern matching and substitutions. This clearly demonstrates that the Dark Knight and Rogerian psychotherapists have much in common! 

## Example

```
$ python batman.py

You wanted me. Here I am.
> What do you want?
I'm the one asking questions! Where are they?
> They are hidden in the docks.
Why hidden in the docks ?
> Nobody told me!
I need names!
> I work for Salvatore Maroni!
You're sure you work for Salvatore Maroni! ?
> Yes!
Where were the other drugs going?
> I don't know, I swear to god!                             
Swear to me!
```
